Description: Tools for the analysis of land use and land cover time series. It 
    includes support for loading spatiotemporal data 'raster map'; simulating 
    landscapes with some degree of spatial correlation; extraction of land use 
    transition matrices; computing of net change and gross changes in a given 
    interval; performing a complete intensity analysis based on Pontius. It 
    provides methods for visualizations of land use and land cover change like
    the outcomes of intensity analysis, as other graphs like sankey diagram 
    (onestep or multistep) and chord diagram displaying the inter-relationships
    between the land uses.
