\description{
This function inplement the Intensity Analysis, a quantitative method to analyze
maps of land categories from several points in time for a single site by
considering cross-tabulation matrices, where one matrix summarizes the change
in each time interval.
}
\details{
There are three levels of analysis, starting from general to more detailed levels, where each level
exposes different types of information given the previous level of analysis
\cite{(Aldwaik and Pontius, 2012, 2013)}.

\enumerate{
 \item The \emph{interval level} examines how the size and speed of change vary
across time intervals.
 \item The \emph{category level} examines how the size and intensity of gross losses
and gross gains in each category vary across categories for each time interval.
 \item The \emph{transition level} examines how the size and intensity of a category’s
transitions vary across the other categories that are available for that transition.
  }


At each level, the method tests for stationarity of patterns across time intervals.
